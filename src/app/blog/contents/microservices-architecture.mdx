## Top 3 advantages of microservices

- Zero Downtime Independent Deployability: Helps with scaling each service independently to handle unequal load.
- Reflect your team's structure: Each team can maintain only their set of service(s). CI/CD pipeline needs less resources as compared to monolith.
- Self-contained data & logic

## Top 3 disadvantages of microservices

- Infrastructure complexity
- Latency
- Risk of failure cascades
