Rule #0: When a component renders, it should do so without running into any side effects.

Rule #1: If a side effect is triggered by an event, put that side effect in an event handler.

Rule #2: If a side effect is synchronizing your component with some external system, put that side effect in `useEffect`.

Rule #3: If a side effect is synchronizing your component with some outside system and that side effect needs to run _before_ the browser paints the screen, put that side effect inside `useLayoutEffect`.

Rule #4: If a side effect is subscribing to an external store, use the `useSyncExternalStore` hook.

Rule #5: Whenever you need to access a reactive but non-synchronizing value inside of `useEffect`, look into abstracting that logic into `useEffectEvent`.
