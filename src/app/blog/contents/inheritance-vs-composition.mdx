Let us first look at an example of how we would achieve inheritance in ES5+

```
class Animal {
    constructor(name, energy) {
        this.name = name
        this.energy = energy
    }
    eat(amount) {
        console.log(`${this.name} is eating.`)
        this.energy += amount
    }
    sleep(length) {
        console.log(`${this.name} is sleeping.`)
        this.energy += length
    }
    play(length) {
        console.log(`${this.name} is playing.`)
        this.energy -= length
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    constructor(name, energy, breed) {
        super(name, energy)
        this.breed = breed
    }
    bark() {
        console.log('Woof Woof!')
        this.energy -= .1
    }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
    constructor(name, energy, declawed) {
        super(name, energy)
        this.declawed = declawed
    }
    meow() {
        console.log('Meow!')
        this.energy -= .1
    }
}
```

We can visualize the hierarchy like so

```
Animal
    name
    energy
    eat()
    sleep()
    play()

    Dog
        breed
        bark()

    Cat
        declawed
        meow()
```

Let's say later on, you are tasked with adding another entity to the system: User.

```
User
    email
    username
    pets
    friends
    adopt()
    befriend()

Animal
    name
    energy
    eat()
    sleep()
    play()

    Dog
        breed
        bark()

    Cat
        declawed
        meow()
```

Everything works fine & dandy till now. However, your project manager now tells you to add the ability of eat, sleep & play to `User` as well. How would you do it? Here's how we would tackle this in OOP

```
Mammal
    name
    eat()
    sleep()
    play()

    User
        email
        username
        pets
        friends
        adopt()
        befriend()

    Animal
        energy

        Dog
            breed
            bark()

        Cat
            declawed
            meow()
```

This looks pretty fragile because another entity had to be introduced which will now have it's own significance as the program grows. This anti-pattern is popularly called `God Object`. Hence, the problem with OOP is that entities have a meaning when you write them which can be changed later as the requirements change. These changes can crumble the class hierarchy structure.

> I think the lack of reusability comes in object-oriented languages, not in functional languages. Because the problem with object-oriented languages is they've got all this implicit environment that they carry around with them. You wanted a banana but what you got was a gorilla holding the banana and the entire jungle.

Rather than thinking what things are, let's shift to what things do.

- A dog is a sleeper, eater, player & barker.
- A cat is a sleeper, eater, player & meower.

Instead of having these methods tightly coupled to a class, we can have have them as functions and compose them together whenever we need. Great! But how do we operate on a specific instance then? Well, we pass the instance directly to our functions. Closure lets the functions `remember` the state(instance) that was passed.

```
const eater = (state) => ({
    eat(amount) {
        console.log(`${state.name} is eating.`)
        state.energy += amount
    }
})
const sleeper = (state) => ({
    sleep(length) {
        console.log(`${state.name} is sleeping.`)
        state.energy += length
    }
})
const player = (state) => ({
    play(length) {
        console.log(`${state.name} is eating.`)
        state.energy -= length
    }
})
const barker = (state) => ({
    bark(length) {
        console.log(`Woof Woof!`)
        state.energy -= .1
    }
})
const meower = (state) => ({
    meow(length) {
        console.log(`Meow!`)
        state.energy -= .1
    }
})
```

Example of Dog being a sleeper, eater, player & barker

```
function Dog(name, energy, breed) {
    let dog = {
        name,
        energy,
        breed
    }

    return Object.assign(
        dog,
        eater(dog),
        sleeper(dog),
        player(dog),
        barker(dog)
    )
}

const dog = Dog('Dog', 10, 'Bulldog')
dog.eat(10)
dog.bark()
```

Now users can also eat, sleep & play

```
function User(email, username) {
    let user = {
        email,
        username,
        pets: [],
        friends: []
    }

    return Object.assign(
        user,
        eater(user),
        sleeper(user),
        player(user)
    )
}
```

Congratulations, you've freed yourself from tightly coupled inheritance structures.
